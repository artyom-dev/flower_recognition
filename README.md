# Image classification using deep learning 

In the framework of this project where trained two famous NN's - Inceptionv3 and EfficientNetb1. Project include following sections

- Explanatory Data Analasys
- Training pipeline

## Data

- Flowers Recognition Dataset with 5 classes of flowers
- Total images: 4317 images
- Daisy: 764 images
- Dandelion: 1052 images
- Rose: 784 images
- Sunflower: 733 images 
- Tulip: 984 images 


## Result
- EfficientNet show pretty good results with:
- Train Accuracy: 94%
- Validation Accuracy: 82%
- Precision/recall: 91%, 86%
- Matthews Corr. coef.: 0.86
- Cohen Kappa: 0.86
- 



## Used libraries and frameworks

During project where used following libraries:

- [PyTorch] - Deep Learning Framework
