# Image classification using deep learning

  

In the framework of this project where trained two famous NN's - Inceptionv3 and EfficientNetb1. Project include following sections

  

- Explanatory Data Analasys

- Training pipeline

  

## Data

  

- Flowers Recognition Dataset with 5 classes of flowers

- Total images: 4317 images

- Daisy: 764 images

- Dandelion: 1052 images

- Rose: 784 images

- Sunflower: 733 images

- Tulip: 984 images

  
  

## Result

- EfficientNet show pretty good results with:

- Train Accuracy: 94%

- Validation Accuracy: 82%

- Precision/recall: 91%, 86%

- Matthews Corr. coef.: 0.86

- Cohen Kappa: 0.86


  
  
  

## Used libraries and frameworks

  

During project where used following libraries:

  


- [PyTorch Lightning](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning) - The lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research. Scale your models, not the boilerplate.

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - awesome data processing library

- [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html) - Tools for working with PyTorch CV related problems.

- [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/site) - Experiment Tracker

- [torchmetrics](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - PyTorch metrics

- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Machine Learning library
